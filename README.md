# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
Project Summary
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the Kaggle Iris dataset. It includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and model saving.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Iris.csv)

Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

Target: Species (three classes)

Tools and Technologies
Python, Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Joblib for saving models

Methodology
Upload and load the dataset in Colab

Perform exploratory data analysis

Encode target labels and split data into training and testing sets

Train multiple models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM (RBF), Random Forest

Use 5-fold cross-validation for model comparison

Select and evaluate the best model

Save the final trained model and label encoder

Outcome
A high-accuracy prediction model capable of classifying Iris species based on floral measurements.
